This project is related to mine because Woojer has a very similar approach to my design intent; make people 'feel' the music. The device assists people feel the music on their body. Woojer markets itself as 'The ultimate on-the-go, hi-fidelity, powerful haptic…well, Strap!'. Woojer strap varies in the way that it does not concentrate on a specific part of the body, but can be worn wherever the user can. It also does not include people with ASD (Austism Spectrum Disorder) and people with hearing disabilities.

**####Skoog####**

This project is related to mine because it tries to simplfy musical instruments, especially for children. Children and even adults who do not know how to play instruments are able to make music through skoog.

**####Touched by Music####**

This project is related to mine because a part of my design intent aligns with this prototype. The designer Katja Riley has built this prototype so that people with hearing disabilities and low hearing can feel music like everyone can. This project varies in a way that this will allow the user to receive and not interact with the signal received.

**####Mobile Music Touch from Georgia Tech####**

This project is related to mine because Mobile Music Touch uses the same principle of vibration to educate users of a skill without an actual instrument. This project stands as an example that tactile feedback can be used to teach people with motor complications.

**####Haptic Feedback for Touchscreens####**

This project is related to mine because this is one of the initial steps to interact with/feel digital artefacts in physical space. The feedback while is haptic, the feeling of the texture is felt by the person using the device.


## Other research ##
1. Autistic Children Are More Responsive to Tactile Sensory Stimulus
Tactile feedback is one of the ways to interact with digital/virtual world. This paper talks about how children with ASD react better to tactile feedback and tactile sensory stimulus. This paper is important to address a part of the major target audience for my project.

2. How to Program the BBC Micobit Accelerometer Using MakeCode
This video that details how to use the MicroBit Radio functionality to create a remote control for a MicroBit controlled car. This explanation helped me understand how to code for the radio functionality.

3. Dissociable sources of erogeneity in social touch: Imagining and perceiving C-Tactile optimal touch in erogenous zones
This paper helped me understand the importance of why neck is an imporatant sensory region.

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

1. 1 x Shaftless Vibration Motor
Purchase - https://core-electronics.com.au/shaftless-vibration-motor-10x3-4mm.html
This motor is one of the output devices for the prototype. It outputs vibration or tactile feedback based on music and  user's manipulation of the music.

2. 2 x Microbit - https://microbit.org/
Purchase - https://core-electronics.com.au/brands/microbit-australia
MicroBit is the core of this product, it is the microcontroller which has the accelerometer, light sensor and the radio function used in this prototype. All the other materials required for this prototype (except the vibration motors) is available in the Inventor's kit. An extra MicroBit is required to use as a remote to manipulate the sound.

3. Other required materials    
    1 x Small Prototype Breadboard
    1 x Transistor
    1 x 2.2KΩ Resistor
    1 x Edge Connector Breakout Board for BBC micro:bit
    5 x Male to Female Jumper Wires
    1 x Piezo Element Buzzer
    2 x Double AAA Battery packs

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
To create a wearable device that'll allow us to interact and manipulate audio and visual elements using haptic feedback. 

### Design concept 1 ###
**####Spiritact####**
To create a wearable tactile spirit level using haptic feedback. Using the accelerometer capability of the microbit the vibration motors fixed on each finger tip through a finger glove will vibrate on each finger based on the direction of tilt.

This is idea was inspired by Teslasuit. teslasuit is a haptic suit that allows people to feel digital objects in Virtual reality. 

### Design concept 2 ###
**####Haptrainer####**

The Haptrainer is a wearable bracelet that will help the user train for driving cars. The accelerometer will decide the threshold of turning the steering wheel and will alert the user with vibration on each wrist. Through practice, the user will remember the amount of effort required.

Mobile Music Touch from Georgia Tech acts on a similar principle helping people learn music instruments.

### Final design concept ###
**WYHIWF - What you hear is what you feel**

####**Concept**####
The WHYIWF - prononced whiff - is a device that is aimed at people with hearing disablities and ASD to feel, manipulate and interact with music through tactile feedback. This device uses vibrations that play in accordance to highs and lows of the music being played. 
The user can also manipulate the pitch and speed of the music using light and accelerometer sensors. This allows the user to feel the music in the way they prefer. The vibrations will change in accordance to the pitch and speed of music.

####**Construction**####
This device will be a wearable that will be worn on the nape of the neck for maximum sensation. The interaction will be manipulated using another MicroBit, where the user can use light sensor and accelerometer to change the pitch and speed of the music.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

The challenge with the physical construction of this device was in making the vibation motor vibrate in sync with the music. As of this stage the music is 8 bit music played through a piezo electric speaker.

## Design process discussion ##
The Double Diamond design process has been very helpful through out this fabrication. It has helped me focus on the problem at hand rather than going on a tanget. By doing adequate research on the currently available technology and devices, I was able to **discover** the problem I need to address. With a plethora of devices with very similar technology to mine, I had to **define** my shortcomings of the problem so that I could **develop** proper solutions. The feedback I had asked from people regarding how they'd like to feel music and how people like having something on their neck has given me a better idea on how to proceed forward.
Using the double diamond process I was able to look at the niche where there are not many devices that address the exact issue of music interactivity for people with hearing disabilities and ASD, I was able to create a basic prototype. I am confident that I can **deliver** a working product after a few cycles of iteration and polishing and user feedback. 

## Next steps ##
Doing this prototype project has me quite excited for the final product. I will not start focusing on making this into a wearable size and updating the components such that they have very low latency and are not uncomfortable for people to wear.

I would also like conduct more user surveys among friends and family increasing my sample size. I feel that this will give me a better idea on the shape and structure I should zero in on.
