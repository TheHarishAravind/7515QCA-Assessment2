### Related project 1 ###
Woojer

*https://www.woojer.com/strap/*

![Image](missingimage.png)

This project is related to mine because Woojer has a very similar approach to my design intent; make people 'feel' the music. The device assists people feel the music on their body. Woojer markets itself as 'The ultimate on-the-go, hi-fidelity, powerful haptic…well, Strap!'. Woojer strap varies in the way that it does not concentrate on a specific part of the body, but can be worn wherever the user can. It also does not include people with ASD (Austism Spectrum Disorder) and people with hearing disabilities.

### Related project 2 ###
Skoog

*https://skoogmusic.com/*

This project is related to mine because it tries to simplfy musical instruments, especially for children. Children and even adults who do not know how to play instruments are able to make music through skoog. 

### Related project 3 ###
Touched by Music

*http://trendnomad.com/tag/touched-by-music-en/*

![Image](missingimage.png)

This project is related to mine because a part of my design intent aligns with this prototype. The designer Katja Riley has built this prototype so that people with hearing disabilities and low hearing can feel music like everyone can. This project varies in a way that this will allow the user to receive and not interact with the signal received. 

### Related project 4 ###
Mobile Music Touch from Georgia Tech

![Image](missingimage.png)

This project is related to mine because Mobile Music Touch uses the same principle of vibration to educate users of a skill without an actual instrument. This project stands as an example that tactile feedback can be used to teach people with motor complications.

### Related project 5 ###
*Haptic Feedback for Touchscreens*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiCqlYKRlAA*

This project is related to mine because this is one of the initial steps to interact with/feel digital artefacts in physical space. The feedback while is haptic, the feeling of the texture is felt by the person using the device.


## Other research ##
1. Autistic Children Are More Responsive to Tactile Sensory Stimulus
Tactile feedback is one of the ways to interact with digital/virtual world. This paper talks about how children with ASD react better to tactile feedback and tactile sensory stimulus. This paper is important to address a part of the major target audience for my project.

2. How to Program the BBC Micobit Accelerometer Using MakeCode
This video that details how to use the MicroBit Radio functionality to create a remote control for a MicroBit controlled car. This explanation helped me understand how to code for the radio functionality.

3. Dissociable sources of erogeneity in social touch: Imagining and perceiving C-Tactile optimal touch in erogenous zones
This paper helped me understand the importance of why neck is an imporatant sensory region.

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

1. 1 x Shaftless Vibration Motor
Purchase - https://core-electronics.com.au/shaftless-vibration-motor-10x3-4mm.html
This motor is one of the output devices for the prototype. It outputs vibration or tactile feedback based on music and  user's manipulation of the music.

2. 1 x Microbit - https://microbit.org/
Purchase - https://core-electronics.com.au/brands/microbit-australia
MicroBit is the core of this product, it is the microcontroller which has the accelerometer, light sensor and the radio function used in this prototype. All the other materials required for this prototype (except the vibration motors) is available in the Inventor's kit. 

3. Other required materials    
    1 x Small Prototype Breadboard
    1 x Transistor
    1 x 2.2KΩ Resistor
    1 x Edge Connector Breakout Board for BBC micro:bit
    5 x Male to Female Jumper Wires
    1 x Piezo Element Buzzer

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
To create a wearable device that'll allow us to interact and manipulate audio and visual elements using haptic feedback. 

### Design concept 1 ###
#Spiritact# 
To create a wearable tactile spirit level using haptic feedback. Using the accelerometer capability of the microbit the vibration motors fixed on each finger tip through a finger glove will vibrate on each finger based on the direction of tilt.

This is idea was inspired by Teslasuit. teslasuit is a haptic suit that allows people to feel digital objects in Virtual reality. 

### Design concept 2 ###
#Haptrainer#

The Haptrainer is a wearable bracelet that will help the user train for driving cars. The accelerometer will decide the threshold of turning the steering wheel and will alert the user with vibration on each wrist. Through practice, the user will remember the amount of effort required.

Mobile Music Touch from Georgia Tech acts on a similar principle helping people learn music instruments.

### Final design concept ###
*WYHIWF - What you hear is what you feel*

The concept

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
