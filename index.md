This project is related to mine because Woojer has a very similar approach to my design intent; make people 'feel' the music. The device assists people feel the music on their body. Woojer markets itself as 'The ultimate on-the-go, hi-fidelity, powerful haptic…well, Strap!'. Woojer strap varies in the way that it does not concentrate on a specific part of the body, but can be worn wherever the user can. While Woojer is stylish, It is not a style statement or a beauty accesory.

This project is related to mine because it tries to simplfy musical instruments, especially for children. Children and even adults who do not know how to play instruments are able to make music through skoog. 

### Related project 3 ###
#### **Touched by Music** ####

This project is related to mine because a part of my design intent aligns with this prototype. The designer Katja Riley has built this prototype so that people with hearing disabilities and low hearing can feel music like everyone can. This project varies in a way that this will allow the user to receive and not interact with the signal received.

This project is related to mine because Mobile Music Touch uses the same principle of vibration to educate users of a skill without an actual instrument. This project stands as an example that tactile feedback can be used to teach people with motor complications.

#### **Haptic Feedback for Touchscreens** ####

This project is related to mine because this is one of the initial steps to interact with/feel digital artefacts in physical space. The feedback is haptic and the feeling of the texture displayed on the flat-screen is felt by the person using the device.


## Other research ##
1. Autistic Children Are More Responsive to Tactile Sensory Stimulus
Tactile feedback is one of the ways to interact with digital/virtual world. This paper talks about how children with ASD react better to tactile feedback and tactile sensory stimulus. This paper is a tangent my project can proceed if the experience is welcomed by all.

2. How to Program the BBC Micobit Accelerometer Using MakeCode
This video that details how to use the MicroBit Radio functionality to create a remote control for a MicroBit controlled car. This explanation helped me understand how to code for the radio functionality.

3. Dissociable sources of erogeneity in social touch: Imagining and perceiving C-Tactile optimal touch in erogenous zones
This paper helped me understand the importance of why neck is an imporatant sensory region.

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

1. 1 x Shaftless Vibration Motor
Purchase - https://core-electronics.com.au/shaftless-vibration-motor-10x3-4mm.html
This motor is one of the output devices for the prototype. It outputs vibration or tactile feedback based on music and  user's manipulation of the music.

2. 1 x Condesing Microphone
Purchase - https://www.jaycar.com.au/standard-microphone-insert/p/AM4010
The microphone is a vital component of the prototype as it is required to sense the music and help convert the signal into light.

4. 1 x Light Dependent Resitor
The Light Dependpent Resistor or LDR is component that changes its resistancce value based on the amount of light incident on it.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
To create a wearable device that'll allow us to interact and feel audio and visual elements through haptic feedback. 

### Design concept 0 ###
#### **Vibestrument** ####
A musical Instrument that gives musical output in the form of vibration. It functions similar to a Theremin. The construction will be such that a MicroBit will be held in hand and will give feedback to the back of your palms and fingers based on the accelerometer movements and light sensitivity.

### Design concept 1 ###
#### **Haptrainer** ####

The Haptrainer is a wearable bracelet that will help the user train for driving cars. The accelerometer will decide the threshold of turning the steering wheel and will alert the user with vibration on each wrist. Through practice, the user will remember the amount of effort required.

Mobile Music Touch from Georgia Tech acts on a similar principle helping people learn music instruments.

### Design concept 2 ###
#### **WYHIWF - What you hear is What you feel** ####



### Final design concept ###
**Sensit**

#### **Concept** ####
The Sensit is a collection devices that are aimed at providing a novel experience for people to feel and interact with music through tactile feedback. This device uses vibrations that play in accordance to highs and lows of the music being played. 
The user can feel the music in their fingertips and this mechanism is activated by light. One of the main devices of Sensit is are finger gloves that give haptic feedback to your fingertips. 

#### **Construction** ####
This experience will consist of 2 wearables
1. Finglet - A finger glove that will be worn on your fingers that will be reactive to the music. 
2. Earworm - An Earring set that give gaptic feedback to your earlobes* 

The Sesnit consists of two main mechanisms,
1. Sound sensing - To feel music, it is also vital that the device senses music. To enable this, a condensig microphone is is used to 'listen' to the music played convert that into light using NPN transistor (2N2222A). 
2. Light sensing- This light varies in its luminosity based on the music beat. The LDR takes the light as input due to which the vibrating motors.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

The challenge with the physical construction of this device was in making the vibation motor vibrate in sync with the music. As of this stage the music is 8 bit music played through a piezo electric speaker.

## Design process discussion ##
The Double Diamond design process has been very helpful through out this fabrication. Having started with my Design Concept 2 as my main project, I was almost at the end of my prototype fabrication. But having a conversation with my Lecturer helped my understand that I have been working with my hands tied behind my back. I had issues in the first section of the double diamond as I was trying to solve a problem I did not have or feel. I had a tunnel vision that I would be able to solve a problem just by reading and researching about it. While my intent was positive, my effort was no answer for the real problems that people faced. Having my head cleared, I had to build my idea from scratch. In this process, I have learnt that the double diamond is a very valuable process to follow. It has also reminded me that not only the result is important, but one can learn a lot from the process also. 

The double diamond process has helped me focus on the problem I know of rather than going on a tanget. By doing adequate research on the currently available technology and devices, I was able to **discover** the problem I need to address; creating an experience for myself to feel music. With a plethora of devices with very similar technology to mine, I was able to **define** my project with much clarity. With my  discussions with many friends and family including my lecturer, I was able to identify the shortcomings of my design. This is now helping me **develop** the experience I want. 
Using the double diamond process I was able to look at the niche where there are not many devices that address the exact issue of music interactivity and 'tactile music experience', I was able to create a basic prototype. I am confident that I can **deliver** a working product after a few cycles of iteration and polishing and user feedback. 

## Next steps ##
1. Doing this prototype project has me quite excited for the final product. I will now start focusing on making this into a wearable form factor.

2. I am also keen on conducting more user surveys among friends. I feel that this will give me a better idea on the shape and structure I should zero in on.

3. Updating the components such that they have very low latency and give instant feedback. Waiting for an Arduino I have ordered to couple it with a Sound Sensor for better feedback.

4. Material selection is also vital part of my process. 

5. Making sure I stay on the same line of thought without going off on a tangent.
